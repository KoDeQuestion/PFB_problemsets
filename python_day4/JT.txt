JT by Shel Silverstein

JT loves me,
JT cares,
JT picks me peaches and pears.
JT offers me candy and Cokes,
JT listens and laughs at me jokes.
JT helps when I get in a fight,
JT does all my homework at night.
JT misses me,
JT cries,
JT thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that JT is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and JT just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for JT's hand,
In the darkness where JT usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
JT's gone!
